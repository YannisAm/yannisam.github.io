                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        With over a decade of hands-on involvement in the world of fruit, the team behind
                        <strong>Erifyli
                            Exports</strong> brings deep knowledge, practical expertise, and a genuine love for what we
                        do. Our
                        goal is to deliver high-quality fresh produce to international markets — always with care,
                        responsibility, and consistency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are a group of passionate professionals who understand the journey of fruit from its origin
                        to its
                        final destination. This background allows us to meet the highest standards in quality and
                        service,
                        ensuring smooth and reliable export operations for our partners around the globe.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
                    <p>
                        While our company is new on paper, our roots run deep. Our team has spent years in the fields,
                        orchards,
                        and packing facilities — not behind desks, but working directly with the produce. This hands-on
                        experience
                        gives us a rare understanding of what truly matters when it comes to freshness, timing, and
                        quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We don’t just export fruit. We ensure it arrives in top condition by overseeing each stage: from
                        responsible growing practices and post-harvest handling to optimal storage and international
                        logistics.
                        Our relationships with trusted growers and research institutions help us stay ahead of evolving
                        standards
                        and consumer expectations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Global Vision, Local Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based in Greece, we are proud to represent the richness of Mediterranean produce. At the same
                        time, we
                        think globally — adapting to the needs of each market, complying with regional regulations, and
                        maintaining
                        clear, honest communication with every client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, our promise is consistent: you’ll get
                        fresh fruit
                        that meets your needs, delivered with the reliability and personal attention of a partner who
                        truly
                        cares.
